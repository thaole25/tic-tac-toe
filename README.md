# tic-tac-toe

Play the game here: https://thaole25.github.io/tic-tac-toe/

I created this project after taking the AI course at Unimelb and freeCodeCamp.org tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2TcQ3h0ipQ&t=2209s

In this project, I implemented the minimax with alpha-beta pruning algorithm to create an AI that plays against human.
